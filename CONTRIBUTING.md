## Coding Standards

The FLYNC project adheres to strict coding standards to ensure consistency, maintainability, and readability across the codebase.

These standards are particularly important when introducing new parts to the model, such as new classes, methods, or configuration validations, to ensure seamless integration with the existing architecture.

This document outlines the coding standards for contributing to the FLYNC project, with a focus on Python conventions, Pydantic model development, and best practices for automotive configuration management.

All contributors must follow these guidelines to maintain the project's quality and compatibility with its license.

### General Python conventions

The FLYNC project follows [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style, with specific conventions tailored to the project's needs.

Key guidelines include:

- **Indentation**: Use 4 spaces per indentation level. Do not use tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to 79 characters for readability.
- **Imports**:
    - Group imports in the following order: standard library, third-party, local project modules.
    - Use explicit imports (e.g., ``from typing import List`` instead of ``import typing``).
- **Naming Conventions**:
    - **Classes**: Use **PascalCase** (e.g., ``SwitchPort``, ``MulticastGroup``).
    - **Methods and Functions**: Use **snake_case** (e.g., ``validate_config``, ``get_config``).
    - **Variables**: Use **snake_case** for variables and attributes (e.g., ``silicon_port_no``, ``default_vlan_id``).
    - **Constants**: Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants (e.g., ``INSTANCES``).
    - **Private Attributes**: Prefix with a single underscore for protected attributes (e.g., ``_mdi_config``) and use ``PrivateAttr`` for Pydantic private attributes.
- **Docstrings**: Follow [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) for docstrings. Use triple double-quotes (``"""``) and include:
    - A brief description of the class, method, or function.
    - Parameters, return values, and exceptions (if applicable) in a structured format.
    - Example for a class:

      ``` python
        class VirtualControllerInterface(FLYNCBaseModel):
        """
        Represents a virtual interface on a controller.

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : str
            Name of the virtual interface.

        vlanid : int
            VLAN identifier in the range 0-4095.

        addresses : list of \
        :class:`~flync.model.flync_4_ecu.sockets.IPv4AddressEndpoint` or \
        :class:`~flync.model.flync_4_ecu.sockets.IPv6AddressEndpoint`
            Assigned IPv4 and IPv6 address endpoints.

        multicast : list of :class:`IPv4Address` or :class:`IPv6Address` \
        or str, optional
            Allowed multicast addresses.
        """

### Pydantic Model Development

FLYNC relies heavily on [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for data validation and model definition.

When introducing new parts to the model (e.g., new classes or fields), adhere to the following standards:

- **Class Definition**:
    - Inherit from ``FLYNCBaseModel`` (a project-specific base class) to ensure consistent validation and configuration.
    - Use **PascalCase** for class names (e.g., ``SwitchPort``, ``VLANEntry``).
    - Include ``UniqueName`` as a mixin if the model requires unique naming within its scope:

    ```python
    class SwitchPort(FLYNCBaseModel, UniqueName):
        name: str
        # ... other fields
    ```

- **Model Configuration**:
    - Set ``model_config`` as desired. Some defaults are already set in ``FLYNCBaseModel``:

    ```python
    FLYNCBaseModel.model_config: ClassVar[ConfigDict] = {'extra': 'forbid'}
    ```
    Configuration for the model, should be a dictionary conforming to [ConfigDict][pydantic.config.ConfigDict].

- **Fields**:
    - Use type hints for all fields, leveraging ``typing`` module types (e.g., ``List``, ``Optional``).
    - For constrained fields, use Pydantic's ``Field`` with appropriate constraints (e.g., ``ge``, ``le``):

    ```python

        default_vlan_id: int = Field(..., ge=0, le=4095)
    ```

    - For union types with discriminators (e.g., different PHY types), use pythons pipe operator:

    ```python
        mii_config: Optional[MII | RMII | SGMII | RGMII | XFI] = pydantic.Field(default=None, discriminator="type")
    ```

    - For private attributes, use Pydantic's ``PrivateAttr``:

    ```python
        _mdi_config: BASET1 | BASET1S | BASET = PrivateAttr()
    ```

    - The field defines how the workspace will look like for this model (read/write). So make sure you're using the correct types and annotations.
      Check out `field_annotations <guidelines/field_annotations.rst>` for more details on the annotations.

    ```python
        info: Annotated["MetadataECU", External(output_structure=OutputStrategy.SINGLE_FILE)] = pydantic.Field()
    ```

- **Validators**:
    - Preferable validators for the fields are validator classes like `BeforeValidator`, `AfterValidator`, `PlainValidator` etc. See [annotated validators](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/validators/#using-the-annotated-pattern).
    - Use Pydantic's ``@field_validator`` and ``@model_validator`` for field-specific and model-wide validations, respectively.
    - Place validators in the appropriate mode (``before``, ``after``) based on the validation needs.
    - Raise descriptive ``ValueError`` exceptions with context:

    ```python
        @field_validator('multicast', mode='after')
        @classmethod
        def validate_multicast_ip(cls, val_list):
            """
            Validates that all provided IP addresses are multicast.

            Raises:
                ValueError: If any address is not a multicast address.
            """
            for val in val_list:
                if val and not val.is_multicast:
                    raise ValueError("Address must be a Multicast Address. Unicast provided")
            return val_list
    ```
    - Ensure validators are specific to the model and avoid generic logic that could belong in a parent class.

- **Documentation**:
    - Provide detailed docstrings for all models, including parameters, constraints, and usage notes.
    - Reference related classes using RST-style links (e.g., ``mii_config (:class:`~flync.model.flync_4_ecu.phy.MII`)``).


### Error Handling and Logging

- **Logging**:
    - Use the ``logging`` module for debugging and informational messages.
    - Log relevant events, such as file parsing or validation steps:

    ```python
        logger.info(f"Parsed Service Interface: {service_interface}")
    ```
- **Error propagation**
    - Use the `err_minor(msg, **ctx)`, `err_major(msg, **ctx)`, `err_fatal(msg, **ctx)` to raise PydanticCustomError with respective severity.

## File and Directory Structure

When introducing new model components, ensure they align with the project's directory structure:

- Place new model classes in the appropriate module (e.g., ``flync/flync_4_ecu/`` for ECU-related models, ``flync/flync_4_tsn/`` for TSN-related models).
- Use descriptive file names in **snake_case** (e.g., ``feature1_part1.py``).
- Maintain a consistent module hierarchy, mirroring the configuration structure (e.g., ``controllers/``, ``ports/``).

> **HINT**: When adding a new model, check for compatibility with existing YAML schemas to avoid breaking existing configurations.

## Testing

All new model components must include tests to validate their behavior:

- **Test Framework**: Use ``pytest`` for unit and integration tests.
- **Test Location**: Place tests in a ``tests/`` directory, mirroring the main codebase structure (e.g., ``tests/flync_4_ecu/test_switch_port.py``).
- **Test Coverage**:
    - Test all fields and validators, including edge cases.
    - Test error conditions (e.g., invalid VLAN IDs, missing required fields).
- Run tests using the following command from the main directory:

```python
    pytest tests/
```

> **WARNING**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request. Untested code will not be accepted.


## Documentation

Update documentation for any changes that affect usage or contribution guidelines.

- **Code Documentation**:
    - Provide comprehensive docstrings for all classes, methods, and functions.
    - Use RST-style references for cross-linking to other classes or modules (e.g., `:class:~flync.model.flync_4_ecu.phy.MII`.
    - Include usage notes for complex configurations (e.g., conditions for optional fields).

- **Project Documentation**:
    - Update any RST file to reflect new model components or changes to existing ones.
    - Update ``docs/source/contributing.rst`` if new contribution processes are introduced.
    - Use reStructuredText (RST) for all documentation files.

> **NOTE**: Preview RST files using a tool like Sphinx or an RST viewer to ensure correct rendering.
