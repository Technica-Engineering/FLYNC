Shared traversal helpers for the ``flync info`` reports.

Every report needs the same walk: ECU -> controller (including switch host controllers, which
``ECU.get_all_interfaces()`` does not cover) -> ethernet interface -> virtual interface / socket
container. These generators do that walk once so each report only has to format the result.
