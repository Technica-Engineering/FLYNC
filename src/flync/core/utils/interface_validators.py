"""Workspace-level validators for bus interface frame references (CAN / CAN FD and LIN).

Complements :mod:`flync.core.utils.forwarder_validators`, which resolves *forwarder* references only.
The passes here cover the plain ``sender_frames`` / ``receiver_frames`` declarations of the bus
interfaces, plus the interface's own ``bus_ref``, so that a dangling id or a CAN interface pointing at
a LIN bus (or vice versa) is reported instead of silently ignored.

    The check is a plain lookup - is this frame id declared on this bus - performed against the catalog of the
    interface's own bus kind. Both aspects are load-bearing:

    *Scoped by bus*, because a CAN id is only unique within a bus: id ``0x100`` on ``CAN1`` and on ``CAN2`` are
    two different frames, which is why :class:`~flync.model.flync_4_ecu.can_interface.CANFrameRef` carries a
    ``bus_ref`` next to the ``frame_ref``. Asking only whether an id exists *somewhere* would accept an interface
    on ``CAN1`` declaring a frame that only exists on ``CAN2``.

    *Scoped by bus kind*, because ``bus_ref`` is a plain string and ``frame_ref`` a plain int - the type system
    stops a ``LINFrameRef`` from landing in a ``CANInterface``, but nothing stops a CAN interface from naming a
    LIN bus. Resolving a CAN interface against ``can_buses`` only is what catches that, so no separate cross-kind
    rule is needed: the LIN bus name simply is not in the CAN catalog. A single catalog merged over both
    kinds would instead accept LIN ids on a CAN interface, and would be ambiguous anyway - bus names are unique
    per kind but not across kinds, so a workspace may hold a CAN bus and a LIN bus of the same name.

    A bus kind whose catalog is empty is skipped: FLYNC supports partial models (an ECU or controller may be
    modelled without the bus catalog it will later be wired into), and there is nothing to resolve against.
    Once a workspace declares buses of a kind, every interface of that kind must resolve.
